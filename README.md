# Divide Students into Teams

Assume that you are the teacher of a classroom with $n$ students. Furthermore, assume that each student $S_i$ is given a score  $C_i$. Your goal is to divide the students into $m$ groups under the following constraint: two students $S_i$ and $S_j$ can be the same group only if the absolute difference between their scores is bounded by a distance $d$, i.e., |$C_i - C_j$|$ \leq d$. Write a program that computes minimal $m$, i.e., the smallest possible number of groups. Note that each group can have as many students as you want as long as the aforementioned constraint is satisfied. Also, different groups may have different number of students. Finally, more than one student may have the same score.
